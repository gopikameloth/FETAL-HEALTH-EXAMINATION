# ABSTRACT

Cardiotocography (CTG) plays a crucial role in monitoring fetal health during pregnancy
by assessing parameters such as fetal heart rate (FHR), uterine contractions, and fetal
movements. Interpretation of CTG results aids in identifying potential risks to the fetus,
allowing for timely interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. In this project, we propose
the development of a machine learning model to classify the outcome of Cardiotocogram
tests into three classes: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological.The dataset utilized in this 
study comprises of features extracted from CTG exams, each classified by expert 
obstetricians into one of the aforementioned classes. Leveraging this dataset, our
objective is to train a classification model capable of accurately predicting the fetal well-being
status based on the extracted features.The successful development of an accurate 
and reliable classification model holds significant clinical implications, empowering 
healthcare professionals to make informed decisions regarding fetal well-being based on 
CTG results. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to improved prenatal care and 
reduced rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes through early detection and intervention.
